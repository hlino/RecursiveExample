# RecursiveExample
This is a program that executes the tasks given by a project in my cs class. The project is meant to show and demonstrate the proper use of recursion. 

The Project:
The incredible Hulk needs to let off some steam by fighting baddies throughout the metropolis. The hulk, though mad, is trying to maximize the number of baddies he beats up without any collateral damage like civilians being destroyed. A square matrix will represent the city the Hulk is trying to save. Each element within the matrix will contain an int value.

  -A positive number represents how many baddies are available in that sector for the hulk to beat up.
  -An element numbered -1 represents a sector containing civilians or businesses that the hulk cannot beat up
  
The Hulk always begins at the top left corner of the grid and his goal is to get to the bottom right corner. He never attempts to move down or to the right. Write a program that explores all the possible valid paths the Hulk can take and determine the largest number of baddies that the hulk could encounter in one valid path.
